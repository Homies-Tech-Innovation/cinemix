# ðŸ“š Project Documentation

This folder contains **all technical and implementation documentation** for the project.  
It is organized so that each component has its own dedicated file to avoid clutter and merge conflicts.

## ðŸ—‚ What Goes Where

### **1. `architecture/`**

For **big-picture** system documentation.

- **`system_overview.md`** â€“ Explain how major components interact, supported with diagrams.
- **`sequence_diagram.png`** â€“ The main request flow (cache hit, cache miss, rate limit, API call).

### **2. `implementation/`**

For **component-level** implementation guidance.
Each file is a **guidance doc** for researching, deciding, and implementing a specific part of the system.

| File                         | Purpose                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `api_integration.md`         | External API usage, request/response DTOs, rate limits, query types. |
| `caching.md`                 | Redis setup, TTL policies, data formats, function signatures.        |
| `rate_limiting.md`           | Algorithm choice, thresholds, middleware flow, function signatures.  |
| `implementation_guidance.md` | Guidance on what to research and how to implement documentation.     |

### **3. `env_variables.md`**

- The **only file** for documenting environment variables.
- Each time a new variable is added, update:
  - **Variable name**
  - **Purpose**
  - **Required/Optional**
  - **Example value (safe)**

## ðŸ›  How to Contribute to Documentation

1. **Pick the correct file** â€” Only edit the file related to your change.
2. **Be specific** â€” Keep updates scoped to your component.
3. **Avoid dumping unrelated changes** into a single commit.
4. **Use Markdown headings** â€” Keep structure clear for easy navigation.
5. **Commit messages** â€” Use clear commit messages for doc changes:

```
docs(caching): add TTL policy section
docs(api_integration): update rate limit details
```

## ðŸ“Œ Tips for Keeping Docs Clean

- **Donâ€™t mix components** â€” API guidance doesnâ€™t go into caching.md.
- **Keep diagrams updated** when architecture changes.
- **Use examples** â€” Code snippets, request/response samples make docs more useful.
- **Keep it short** â€” Link to external sources for deep explanations.

âœ… Following this structure will make sure docs stay clean, easy to navigate, and helpful for onboarding new developers.
